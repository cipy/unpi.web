## Hi there,

This project [site](https://www.unpi.ro/) is about helping _unprivileged_ children from Romania to _learn programming_ in [Golang](https://golang.org) using a tailored [programming course for children](https://go.unpi.ro/) created by [Ciprian Manea](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ciprian-manea/) in the Romanian language.

Golang is a modern programming language invented at Google (by one of the creators of the [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) & others)). This language (Go) was designed from the get go to be **simple** to learn, **safe** to use, with built-in support for _concurrency_ and _multi platform_.

In Computer Science engineering _speak_: **concurrency** is the capacity of a program to run inside a computer on all installed processors at the same time, and _true_ **multi platform** means you write your program once, but then compile & use it on various computer types: from the very small like [RPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org), to tablets, laptops, desktops, up to room sized servers.

## Why [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania)?

- it's [my](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ciprian-manea/) home country. I'm paying it forward.
- while [gifted Romanian students](https://space.nss.org/settlement/nasa/Contest/Results/2019/) have graduated every year from US Ivy League Universities, had or are still working at Google/ Microsoft/ Amazon/ Facebook/ other Fortune 50 companies, the country as a whole has not changed (that) much. And the _real_ reasons are too many to list here, _unfortunately_.
- its Internet infrastructure is [top notch](http://business-review.eu/news/romania-has-5th-fastest-internet-speed-in-the-world-176801) (#5 worldwide)
- the cheapest monthly [Internet subscription](https://www.digiromania.ro/servicii/internet) at one of the leading national providers is today 30 RON, or about 7,15 USD and gives you 300Mbps download with 150Mbps upload. Hello Western Europe?!
- a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/specifications/) computer has 4 cores (small processors) and a fast network interface, asking for Golang programmers ü§ì

## What are we gifting to a Romanian child?

- an [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 4GB RAM Starter Kit](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0BJ278V6W/)
- a (wireless) [keyboard with built-in trackpad](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07HG5Q851/)
- [AAA batteries for the (wireless) keyboard](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B00009X3EV/)
- a [professional network cable](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00QV1F160/) (up to 10Gbit/s)
- an [Official Raspberry Pi Beginner's Guide](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Gareth-Halfacree/dp/191204773X/)

###### NOTE: the project is now oficially registered in Romania as a Non Profit / NGO named ‚ÄúAsocia»õia unPi pentru »òcolari‚Äù

Best wishes,

Ciprian & co
