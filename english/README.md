## Hi there,

I guess you came here via our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/unPi) page.

This [site](https://www.unpi.ro/), project and github [repository](https://github.com/cipy/unpi.web) are about helping _unprivileged_ children from Romania get _fast_ access to the Internet, and especially _start programming_ in [Golang](https://golang.org) using a tailored course in the Romanian language.

Go is a modern programming language invented at Google (by one of the founders of the [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) & others)). This language was designed from the get go to be **simple** to learn, **safe** to use, with built-in support for _concurrency_ and _multi platform_.

In Computer Science engineering _speak_: **concurrency** is the capacity of a program to run inside a computer on all installed processors at the same time, and _true_ **multi platform** means you write your program once, but then compile & use it on various computer types: from the very small like [Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org), to tablets, laptops, desktops, up to room sized servers.

## Why [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania)?

- it's [my](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ciprianalexandrumanea/) home country. I'm paying it forward.
- while [gifted Romanian students](https://space.nss.org/settlement/nasa/Contest/Results/2019/) have graduated every year from US Ivy League Universities, had or are still working at Google/ Microsoft/ Amazon/ Facebook/ other Fortune 50 companies, the country as a whole has not changed (that) much. And the _real_ reasons are too many to list here, _unfortunately_.
- its Internet infrastructure is [top notch](http://business-review.eu/news/romania-has-5th-fastest-internet-speed-in-the-world-176801) (#5 worldwide)
- the cheapest monthly [Internet subscription](https://www.digiromania.ro/servicii/internet) at one of the leading national providers is today 30 RON, or about 7,15 USD and gives you 300Mbps download with 150Mbps upload. Hello Western Europe?!
- [Raspberry Pi 3 B+](https://static.raspberrypi.org/files/product-briefs/Raspberry-Pi-Model-Bplus-Product-Brief.pdf) has 4 cores (small processors) and 300Mbps network interface, asking for Golang programmers ðŸ¤“

## What are you gifting to a Romanian child?

- [Raspberry Pi 3 B+ Ultimate Starter Kit](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07DDCRFP6/) â‚¬80
- [keyboard with built-in trackpad](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07HG5Q851/) (wireless) â‚¬20
- [professional network cable](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00QV1F160/) â‚¬9
- delivery costs from Amazon.de to Romania, about â‚¬10

###### P.S: the project is at the moment a private initiative (to keep _maintenance_ costs down, etc), it will be registered in Romania or Finland (_my current residence_) as a Non Profit when it becomes successful (maintenance or taxation exceed my possibilities).

From my side, my supporters, and likely the future computer science careers we're likely to shape together: **I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your hard earned contribution** and we'll be forever in your debt.
